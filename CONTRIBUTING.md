## 📝 Commit Guidelines (Strict)

We follow a strict **Modular Commit** philosophy to ensure history is readable and revertible.

**The Golden Rule:**
> "Commit after every meaningful change, not every line."

*   **Meaningful Change:** Completing a function, finishing a fix, adding a feature block, creating a file, or making a significant modification.
*   **Avoid:** Micro-commits for single-line edits unless they are standalone fixes.
*   **Frequency:** Commit often, but only when you finish a logical piece of work.

### Example Commit Messages
*   `feat(contract): implement yield allocation logic`
*   `fix(ui): correct risk visualization chart`
*   `docs: update fx data source list`
